    <p>Welcome to the help page for <span>Join</span>, your
        guide to using our kanban project
        management tool. Here, we'll provide an overview of what <span>Join</span>
        is, how it can benefit you, and
        how to use it.</p>
    <h2 class="headline-main-2nd version-btn-3rd">What is Join?</h2>
    <div class="version-2-body"><span>Join</span> is a kanban-based project management
        tool designed and built by a
        group of dedicated students as part of their web development bootcamp at the Developer
        Akademie.<br><br>

        Kanban, a Japanese term meaning "billboard", is a highly effective method to visualize work,
        limit work-in-progress, and maximize efficiency (or flow). <span>Join</span>
        leverages the principles of
        kanban to help users manage their tasks and projects in an intuitive, visual interface.<br><br>

        It is important to note that <span>Join</span> is designed as an
        educational exercise and is not intended for
        extensive business usage. While we strive to ensure the best possible user experience, we cannot
        guarantee consistent availability, reliability, accuracy, or other aspects of quality regarding
